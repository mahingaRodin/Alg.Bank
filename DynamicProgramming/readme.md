### Imagine This:
You are going on a picnic, and you have a **small bag** (your knapsack). The bag can only hold **a certain weight**—let’s say **5 kilograms**.

Now, in your room, you have a bunch of items like:

1. **An apple** (1 kg)  
2. **A juice box** (2 kg)  
3. **A chocolate bar** (1 kg)  
4. **A sandwich** (3 kg)  
5. **A water bottle** (4 kg)

But here’s the problem:  
You **can’t take everything**, because your bag has a limit of **5 kg**. 

So, you have to decide:  
- Which items to take so that you get the **most fun** (value) on your picnic?

---

### What’s the Goal?
The goal is to pack your bag with the **best combination of items** so you can enjoy the picnic the most, without the bag becoming too heavy.

---

### How Does It Work?
Each item has:
1. **A weight** (how heavy it is).
2. **A value** (how much fun it gives you).

For example:
- An apple: **1 kg**, **value = 3 points**
- A juice box: **2 kg**, **value = 5 points**
- A chocolate bar: **1 kg**, **value = 4 points**
- A sandwich: **3 kg**, **value = 6 points**
- A water bottle: **4 kg**, **value = 8 points**

Now you figure out:
- If you take the water bottle (4 kg, 8 points), you can only take 1 more kg.
- Or maybe you take the apple (1 kg, 3 points), the juice box (2 kg, 5 points), and the chocolate bar (1 kg, 4 points). That’s **12 points** but still under 5 kg!

---

### Steps to Solve It:
1. **Look at all the items** and their weights and values.
2. **Choose items that give the most value** without going over the weight limit.
3. Add up the value of the items you picked.

---

### What the Computer Does:
The computer tries **all possible combinations of items** to find the best one. It’s like trying every way to fill the bag, but much faster!

---

### Example for the Picnic Bag:
For a **5 kg bag**, the best choice is:  
- **Juice box (2 kg, 5 points)** + **Chocolate bar (1 kg, 4 points)** + **Apple (1 kg, 3 points)** = 12 points!
